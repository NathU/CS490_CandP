A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization; it comprises a thread ID, a program
counter, a register set, and a stack. It shares with other threads belonging
to the same process its code section, data section, and other operating-system
resources, such as open files and signals. A traditional (or heavyweight) process
has a single thread of control. If a process has multiple threads of control, it
can perform more than one task at a time. Figure 4.1 illustrates the difference
between a traditional single-threaded process and a multithreaded process.
